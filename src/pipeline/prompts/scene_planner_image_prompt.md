Generate a **SINGLE STATIC IMAGE** (photograph or illustration).

This image represents **one frozen moment** from a continuous video.
It is NOT an animation, diagram, or multi-frame scene.

---

## SCENE CONTEXT

SCENE {scene_number} of {total_scenes}  
POSITION IN STORY: {position_context}

SCENE DESCRIPTION (cleaned for visuals):
{cleaned_visual_description}

---

## VISUAL WORLD LOCK (CRITICAL)

Assume:
- All scenes belong to the SAME video
- Same visual universe, same rules
- Same artistic intent, same emotional tone

This image should feel like the **next frame** in a sequence,
not a new illustration style or setting.

If this image would look out of place next to previous scenes,
rewrite it until it doesn't.

## COMPOSITION FOR KEN BURNS EFFECT

This image will have a slow zoom or pan applied.
Design it with **clear depth layers**:

- **FOREGROUND**
  - Closest elements to the viewer
  - Can be partially blurred or cropped
- **MIDGROUND (FOCAL POINT)**
  - Main subject
  - Sharpest detail and highest contrast
- **BACKGROUND**
  - Context and atmosphere
  - Softer focus but visually interesting

Use photographic language:
- close-up / medium shot / wide shot
- shallow or deep depth of field
- centered, rule-of-thirds, negative space

Avoid describing camera movement.

Ken Burns motion will be added later.

## VISUAL CONTINUITY (MANDATORY)

Follow these instructions strictly:
{continuity_instruction}

You MUST:
- Maintain the same color palette
- Maintain the same lighting logic
- Maintain the same visual metaphor or setting

---

## CONSISTENT STYLE (LOCKED)

Color Palette:
{color_palette}

Lighting Style:
{lighting}

Visual Aesthetic:
{visual_style}

Do NOT introduce new styles unless explicitly instructed.

---

## RECURRING VISUAL MOTIFS

At least ONE of the following must appear in this scene:
{recurring_motifs}

These motifs act like visual callbacks.
They should feel intentional, not decorative.

---

## SCENE-SPECIFIC ELEMENTS

This scene MUST include:
{key_visual_elements}

Ensure these elements integrate naturally into the scene,
not pasted in artificially.

---

## MOOD: {mood}

{mood_visual_guide}

The mood should be visible through:
- Lighting
- Color balance
- Framing
- Subject posture or environment

---

## COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS

{composition_hint}

Aspect Ratio:
{aspect_ratio}

{format_specific_instructions}

Ensure:
- Clear focal point
- Balanced composition
- Space that allows text overlay later if needed

---

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

- High resolution
- Professional-quality illustration or photography
- Sharp detail on focal subject
- Subtle depth of field
- Clean edges and readable silhouette

---

## ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❌ NO text, words, letters, numbers, or symbols  
❌ NO animation or motion blur  
❌ NO action sequences  
❌ NO multiple panels or comic layouts  
❌ NO UI elements, charts, or interface graphics  

Describe ONLY what is visible in ONE frozen frame.

Think like a photographer capturing the perfect moment,
not an animator planning motion.
