Create a **45–60 second short-form video script** about **"{topic}"**.

TARGET AUDIENCE: {target_audience}  
STYLE: {style}

You are writing spoken narration that will be read aloud.
It must sound natural, smooth, and intentional — never scripted or list-like.

---

## INPUT MATERIAL (DO NOT REPEAT VERBATIM)

KEY POINTS:
{key_points_text}

{examples_text}
{analogies_text}

Use these as raw material, not as structure.
Rewrite everything into a flowing narrative.

---

## STEP 1: DEFINE THE STORY (DO THIS INTERNALLY)

Before writing the script, decide:
- CENTRAL QUESTION:
  > What single question does this video answer?
- FALSE INTUITION:
  > What does the viewer likely believe that is incomplete or wrong?
- PAYOFF:
  > What realization should the viewer have in the final seconds?

Every scene must serve this.

---

## STEP 2: STRUCTURE THE SCRIPT

You decide:
- How many scenes are needed (2–6 typical)
- How long each scene should be
- Where tension rises and resolves

There is NO fixed structure — only narrative logic.

---

## HOOK CONSTRAINT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The first **2–3 sentences** MUST:
- Create curiosity or tension
- Challenge a common assumption
- Avoid definitions or background explanations

❌ BAD:
"This video explains how X works."

✅ GOOD:
"Most people think X works because of Y. That sounds reasonable — until you notice what actually happens."

The hook must feel unresolved until the end.

---

## SCENE FLOW RULES (STRICT)

### Scene 1
- Introduce the central question or problem
- Create a promise of understanding later

### Scenes 2+
Each scene MUST:
- START with a transition phrase that connects to the previous scene  
  Examples:
  - "But here's the part people miss…"
  - "That explanation almost works — except…"
  - "This is where it starts to matter…"
- BUILD directly on what was just said
- END by naturally setting up the next idea

Scenes must feel like one continuous monologue.

---

## ENDING REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)

The final scene MUST:
- Clearly answer the central question
- Resolve the tension created in the opening
- Reframe the topic in a memorable way

Avoid:
- Summaries
- Cliffhangers
- Teasers for other videos

The ending should feel emotionally complete.

---

## VISUAL DESCRIPTIONS (STATIC IMAGES ONLY)

For EACH scene, provide:
- **Scene duration (seconds)**
- **Narration**
- **visual_description**: a SINGLE STATIC IMAGE

Rules for visuals:
- Describe a frozen moment only
- Use foreground / midground / background layers
- No motion, animation, or camera language
- All scenes must feel like frames from the SAME visual world

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT (REQUIRED)

For each scene, output:

### Scene X
- **Duration:** __ seconds  
- **Narration:**  
  Spoken text only  
- **visual_description:**  
  Static image description  
- **key_visual_elements:**  
  Recurring + scene-specific elements

---

## FINAL SELF-CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before finishing, confirm:
- This reads smoothly when spoken aloud
- No scene feels disconnected from the one before it
- The ending resolves the opening hook
- Visual descriptions are static and visually consistent

If any check fails, revise before outputting.
