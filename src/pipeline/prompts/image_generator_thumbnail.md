Generate a **SINGLE, STATIC YouTube thumbnail image**.

This image must stop the viewer mid-scroll.
It is NOT an illustration for explanation — it is a visual HOOK.

## VIDEO CONTEXT

Title: {title}  
Topic: {topic}  
Target Audience: {target_audience}  
Format: {format_type}

Viewing Context:
- Orientation: {orientation}
- Primary platform: {viewing_context}

---

## THUMBNAIL OBJECTIVE (CRITICAL)

The thumbnail must:
- Create curiosity WITHOUT explaining the video
- Suggest tension, imbalance, or mystery
- Visually imply that something is "not quite right"
- Make the viewer want resolution

If the image already answers the video's question,
it has failed.

## SCROLL-STOPPING PSYCHOLOGY

Design the image so that at **120×90 px** it still:
- Has a clear silhouette
- Has ONE dominant focal point
- Communicates emotion instantly

Favor:
- Faces with readable emotion
- Strong contrast between subject and background
- Visual asymmetry or imbalance
- Lighting that feels dramatic but intentional

Avoid:
- Symmetry that feels calm or complete
- Neutral expressions
- Busy scenes with multiple focal points

---

## COMPOSITION RULES

- ONE clear subject only
- Subject occupies a large portion of the frame
- Strong foreground/background separation
- Clean background with minimal detail
- Negative space reserved for optional text overlay (but DO NOT include text)

Orientation:
- Optimize composition for {orientation}

---

## COLOR & LIGHTING

- Bold, saturated colors that survive YouTube compression
- High contrast between subject and background
- Lighting should support the emotion:
  - Mystery → directional, shadowed
  - Shock → high contrast, sharp light
  - Curiosity → rim light, spotlight effect

Mood to evoke: **{mood}**

---

## MICRO-STORY REQUIREMENT

The thumbnail should tell a **micro-story**:
- Something has just happened OR
- Something is about to happen

But never show:
- The resolution
- The explanation
- The outcome

Think: "I need to know why."

---

## TECHNICAL QUALITY

- High resolution
- Professional photography or illustration quality
- Crisp edges and strong color separation
- Works in both light and dark mode
- Clear even when heavily downscaled

---

## ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❌ NO text, words, letters, numbers, or symbols  
❌ NO logos, watermarks, or branding  
❌ NO arrows, circles, or clickbait graphics  
❌ NO UI elements or screenshots  
❌ NO collages or split frames  
❌ NO washed-out or low-contrast colors  

Describe ONLY what is visible in ONE frozen image.

---

## FINAL CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before finalizing, confirm:
- Does this create curiosity without explaining?
- Would this stand out next to 20 other thumbnails?
- Would someone click this without reading the title?

If not, redesign it.
