## START WITH THE STORY (MANDATORY)

Before listing anything, decide internally:
- What the viewer probably believes right now
- What they are confused about or missing
- What realization will make them feel smarter by the end

Your research should feel like the OUTLINE of a story, not notes.

---

## KEY POINTS (5–7 REQUIRED)

Provide **5–7 narrative key points** that explain the topic.

Each key point MUST:
- Introduce a cause, tension, misconception, or mystery
- Logically require the next point to exist
- Move the viewer closer to clarity

Rules:
- Write in plain language, not academic phrasing
- Avoid standalone facts
- Reordering these points should BREAK the story

Think: documentary beats, not bullet notes.

---

## FACTS (3–5 REQUIRED)

Provide **3–5 accurate, interesting facts** that strengthen the story.

Each fact should:
- Create a "wait, really?" moment OR
- Sharpen understanding of a key point
- Be directly usable in narration

Requirements:
- Include source attribution
- Use "general knowledge" only when appropriate
- Prefer surprising or counterintuitive facts

Avoid trivia that does not move the narrative forward.

---

## EXAMPLES (2–4 REQUIRED)

Provide **2–4 concrete, real-world examples**.

Each example should:
- Be immediately relatable to {target_audience}
- Clearly demonstrate a key point in action
- Use specific names, situations, or events

Avoid:
- Hypotheticals
- Generic placeholders
- Overly abstract scenarios

---

## ANALOGIES (2–3 REQUIRED)

Provide **2–3 analogies** that simplify complex ideas.

Each analogy should:
- Use familiar concepts the audience already understands
- Reduce mental effort, not add to it
- Map cleanly to the concept being explained

Analogies should be memorable enough to reuse word-for-word in a script.

---

## RELATED TOPICS (2–3 REQUIRED)

Suggest **2–3 natural follow-up topics** that:
- A curious viewer would want to watch next
- Extend the same theme or mental model
- Help build a coherent content series

Avoid random or loosely related topics.

---

## FINAL QUALITY CHECK (IMPORTANT)

Before finalizing, ensure:
- This reads like a story outline, not research notes
- Each section supports smooth transitions in a script
- Nothing feels filler or "nice-to-know"

If a point does not serve the story, remove it.
