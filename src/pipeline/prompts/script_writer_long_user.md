Create a **{min_duration}–{max_duration} minute long-form educational video**
about **"{topic}"**.

TARGET AUDIENCE: {target_audience}  
STYLE: {style}

This script will be read aloud.
It must sound natural, smooth, and intentional.

---

## INPUT MATERIAL (DO NOT COPY VERBATIM)

KEY POINTS:
{key_points_text}

FACTS:
{facts_text}

EXAMPLES:
{examples_text}

Use these as raw material.
Rewrite everything into a single flowing narrative.

---

## STEP 1: DEFINE THE STORY (INTERNAL)

Before writing, decide:
- CENTRAL QUESTION
- FALSE INTUITION
- FINAL REALIZATION

The viewer should feel smarter by the end.

---

## STEP 2: STRUCTURE THE JOURNEY

You decide:
- How many scenes are needed
- How long each scene should be
- Where curiosity rises and resolves

There is NO fixed number of scenes.
Narrative logic comes first.

---

## OPENING CONSTRAINT (CRITICAL)

The opening must:
- Create curiosity or tension
- Challenge a common assumption
- Avoid definitions or background explanations

❌ BAD:
"This video explains how X works."

✅ GOOD:
"Most people assume X works because of Y. That assumption quietly breaks everything that follows."

The opening promise must be resolved in the final scenes.

---

## SCENE FLOW RULES (STRICT)

### Scene 1
- Introduce the central question
- Create a narrative promise

### Scenes 2+
Each scene MUST:
- START with a transition phrase connecting to the previous idea
- BUILD directly on what was just established
- END by setting up the next concept

The viewer should never feel lost or jumped forward.

---

## VISUAL DESCRIPTIONS (STATIC IMAGES ONLY)

For EACH scene, include:
- **Scene duration**
- **Narration**
- **visual_description** (single static image)
- **key_visual_elements**

Visual rules:
- Describe a frozen moment only
- Include foreground / midground / background
- No animation, motion, or camera language
- Maintain the same visual world across scenes

---

## ENDING REQUIREMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The final scenes MUST:
- Answer the central question clearly
- Resolve the opening tension
- Leave the viewer with a clear takeaway

Avoid:
- Abrupt endings
- Cliffhangers
- Summary-only conclusions

The ending should feel complete.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT (REQUIRED)

### Scene X
- **Duration:** __ seconds  
- **Narration:**  
  Spoken text only  
- **visual_description:**  
  Static image description  
- **key_visual_elements:**  
  Recurring + scene-specific elements

---

## FINAL SELF-CHECK

Before finishing, confirm:
- This reads smoothly when spoken aloud
- No scene feels independent or skippable
- The opening promise is fulfilled at the end

If not, revise.
